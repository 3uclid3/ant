## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- New PlantUML class diagrams under `docs/uml/class/` for `core` and `database`.
- Draft/aspirational database diagram under `docs/uml/class/draft/`.
- Contribution guide overhaul in `AGENTS.md` (concise, human/AI-friendly); formatting aligned to repository `.clang-format`.
- Dependabot configuration for GitHub Actions and Docker; PRs labeled `build` and `deps`, with minor/patch updates grouped.
- Bitset iteration helpers to visit set/unset bits with optional early exit. (#33)
- Bulk operations to set or clear all logical bits in bitset. (#33)

### Changed

- README simplified with a quick start, small layout overview, and a link to `AGENTS.md`.
- Documented verbose test/benchmark output via `xmake test -v â€¦` in README and `AGENTS.md`.
- CI workflows now also trigger on documentation changes (`docs/**`).
- CI: ignore `.github/dependabot.yml` on push; PR checks still run.
- **BREAKING**: Bitset `size()` now returns the exact logical size instead of rounding to block boundaries. (#33)
- **BREAKING**: Bitset constructors and `resize()` no longer round to block boundaries. (#33)
- **BREAKING**: Setting a bitset bit beyond the current end now grows the logical size automatically. (#33)
- Bitset operations (`all`, `none`, `count`) now correctly ignore unused tail bits. (#33)

### Removed

- Obsolete UML diagrams removed: `docs/uml/database.pu`, `docs/uml/attach-structural-migration.pu` (superseded by `docs/uml/class/**`).
